Post as in "after", yes, but also post as in <code><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.post.php">$_POST</a></code>.  Eval as in our old enemy <code><a href="http://us.php.net/eval">eval()</a></code>.  This function is called on every single <code>$_POST</code> key/value pair after form submission.  <code>$On_Insert</code> is an array of executable PHP code stored in the database.  Figure out the rest of the misery yourself; I might jump off a cliff if I have to think through this code again.
<pre lang="PHP">
Function doPostEval($Key,$Value,$On_Insert)
{
    $Code = $On_Insert[$Key];
    $xxx = '';
    if ($Code <> '') {
        eval($Code);
        return($xxx);
    } else {
        return($Value);
    }
}
</pre>
