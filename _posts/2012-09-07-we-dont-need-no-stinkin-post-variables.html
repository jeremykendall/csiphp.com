CSI: PHP investigator <a href="https://twitter.com/duanegran">Duane Gran</a> sent in this horrifying snippet.  He explains

<blockquote>I wondered why dumping the $_POST variables before this section didn't help in debugging.  This occurs in a second step of a 3-step form on a GET request.  It applies a set of session fields to the $_POST variable for later use.</blockquote>

<pre lang="php">
foreach($_SESSION["purchase"] as $key => $value)
{
    switch($key)
    {	
      case "process_purchase":
          break;
      default:
          $_POST[$key] = $value;
          break;
    }
}
</pre>
