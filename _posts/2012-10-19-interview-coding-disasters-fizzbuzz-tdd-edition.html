Today's anonymous submitter is shocked to discover that FizzBuzz really works (and TDD isn't as alive and well as he'd hoped).

<blockquote>A local company asked me for assistance recruiting a new PHP developer.  I helped them come up with a job description, a few interview questions, and I threw in the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest">FizzBuzz test</a> for good measure.  Since they're working on implementing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a>, I added " . . . bonus points for writing FizzBuzz using TDD."  I was horrified to see the massive fail that were the FizzBuzz submissions, but the single TDD submission took the cake.</blockquote>

Interestingly, it looks like the FizzBuzz portion of the submission probably works.  It would have been a good idea if the submitter had read something, anything, about TDD before trying his hand at it in an interview situation.

<pre lang="PHP">
<?php

class FizzBuzzTest {
	//build array that contains inputs 1-100
	public function totalInput() {
		
		$results = array();
		
		for( $i=1; $i<=100; $i++ ) {
			$results[] = $i;
		}
		
		return $results;
	}
	
	//build array that controls ttd test inputs 1-15
	public function tddInput() {
		
		$results = array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15);
		
		return $results;
	}
	
	//compare tddInput with the expected results
	public function testInput($source) {
		
		if($source == 'short') {
			$input = array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15);
		} else if($source == 'long') {
			$input = $this->totalInput();
		}
		
		$test = new runTest();
		
		$expected = array(1,2,'Fizz',4,'Buzz','Fizz',7,8,'Fizz','Buzz',11,'Fizz',13,14,'FizzBuzz');
		
		$testResults = $test->process($input);
		
		if($source == 'long') {
			return $testResults;
		} else {
			$this->assertEquals($expected, $testResults);
		}
	}
}

//replace multiples of 3 with FIZZ
//replace multiples of 5 with BUZZ
//replace multiples of 3 & 5 with FIZZBUZZ
//if none apply, show number
class runTest {
	public function process($input) {
		
		$results = array();
		
		foreach($input as $value) {
			
			$output = '';
			
			if($value % 3 == 0 && $value % 5 == 0) {
				$output = 'FizzBuzz';
			} elseif($value % 3 == 0) {
				$output = 'Fizz';
			} elseif($value % 5 == 0) {
				$output = 'Buzz';
			} else {
				$output = $value;
			}
			
			$results[] = $output;
		}
		
		return $results;
	}
