This is one of the few comment blocks that accurately describes the code contained in the script. I wish it didn't.
<pre lang="PHP">/*
*
*    Written by [redacted] the purpose of this script is to Bounce
*    shall-not.be-named.com requests to the appropriate web page
*    within the Iframe.
*
*    Basically the 3rd party site creates an Iframe
*    Within in the Iframe it calls this script
*    and passes various variables
*    This Script evaluates the pageid variable
*    And basically constructs a partial page that
*    MAY include legal disclamers
*    And then either URL encodes or Posts the
*    Variables necessary
*    Launches a remote application or site within
*    the Iframe created below
*
*    Gotchas: You have two Iframes... One at the other
*    site and One created Here... Scroll Bar Sizing Issues
*
*/</pre>
That ain't the only gotcha, bud.
