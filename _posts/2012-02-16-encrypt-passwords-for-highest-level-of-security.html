Thanks to Justin Carmony for this awesome slice of fail.

<pre lang="php">class SecurityFail
{

    // Encrypt Passwords for Highest Level of Security.
    static public function encrypt($pword)
    {
        return md5($pword);
    }

}</pre>

There are right ways and wrong ways to encrypt and store passwords, and a simple md5() hash is one of the wrong ways. Here are some links you might research instead of rolling your own crypto.
