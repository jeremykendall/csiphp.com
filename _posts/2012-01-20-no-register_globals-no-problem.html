<blockquote>"So I found this today in a commercial product that we purchased and I know you'll want to pull your eyes out their sockets as I did when I found this.  The script was originally written for php4 and now they've gone through the refactoring to make this php 5 compliant ::cough::.   This script apparently relied on <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.register-globals">register_globals</a> to be set (which most php apps at the time did).  No problems, per-say, it was the trend back then... But now that PHP 5 is out and register_globals is no more, here's this guys solution to fix the problem...  Lazy like.

Who needs register globals when you can just mock up your own?"</blockquote>

<pre lang="php">
function get_all_vars() {
    $array=array('_GET', '_POST', '_SESSION', '_COOKIE');
    foreach($array as $key => $var) {
        global $$var;
        foreach ($$var as $k => $v) {
            global $$k;
            $$k=$v;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
