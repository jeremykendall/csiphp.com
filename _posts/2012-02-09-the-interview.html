Yes, this really happened.

<blockquote>Q: How long have you been working with PHP?

A: About 8 years.

Q: On a scale of 1 - 10, how would you rate your proficiency with PHP?

A: I'd say I'm an expert.

Q: Can you tell me the difference between an <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.abstract.php">abstract class</a> and an <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php">interface</a>, and when you might use either?

A: Is that a Java question?</blockquote>
