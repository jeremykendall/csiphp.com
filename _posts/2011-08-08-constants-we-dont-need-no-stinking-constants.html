<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php">PHP_MAJOR_VERSION</a>?  Screw it, I'll do it myself.
<pre lang="php">
if (floor(phpversion()) >= 5)
{
    $this->load =& load_class('Loader');
    $this->load->_ci_autoloader();
}
</pre>
Just to be clear, there's nothing <em>necessarily</em> criminal about today's code. Rather, it's an example of code that could be written in a cleaner, more efficient manner.  Today's lesson might be, "Knowing your language is the path to better code."

Now you know about PHP_MAJOR_VERSION, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pele5vptVgc">and knowing is half the battle</a>.

Today's snippet comes courtesy of an anonymous submitter.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Yeah, remember what I said about "Knowing your language . . ."?  Well, I just got schooled.  Commenter <a href="http://csiphp.com/blog/2011/08/08/constants-we-dont-need-no-stinking-constants/#comment-164">Josh Woody</a> demonstrates how using PHP_MAJOR_VERSION wouldn't really be any better, and his point is well taken.  Since PHP_MAJOR_VERSION has only been available since PHP 5.2.7, it wouldn't be much use in any version prior to 5.2.7. /facepalm.
