This is a fun one. It's being called 12 separate times in a 228 line switch statement, with all of the calls inside <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.else.php">if/else</a> and nested if/else statements.
<pre lang="PHP">function getRules($conn, $dbn, $app, $table, $action, $actiontype, $RecordID='')
{
    global $self;
    $savTBL = $table;
    require_once "../common.inc";
    if ((!$table) || ($table = '')) {
        return(0);
    } else {
        $Q = "SELECT * FROM dbrules WHERE ontable = '$savTBL' AND onaction = '$action' AND app = '$app' AND actiontype = '$actiontype' ORDER BY doorder ";
        $R = mSDoQuery($conn, $dbn, $Q);
        if (mssql_num_rows($R) == 0) {
            return(0);
        }
        While ($row = mssql_fetch_assoc($R)) {
            foreach ($row AS $Key => $Value) {
                $$Key = $Value;
            }
            if ($fromfile <> '') {
                require_once "$fromfile";
            }
            if ($PassedValue <> '') {
                eval("$PassedValue" . ";");
            }
            if ($doAction) {
                eval("$doAction" . ";");
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
A few details:
<ul>
	<li>common.inc is a ~2,000 line file with 22 "common" functions, only one of which is used in getRules().</li>
	<li>Don't let $self fool you, this isn't a class method. $self is set to <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];</code>.</li>
	<li>The function parameters are set from from $_GET, an included config file, a database query, with only two being hard coded.</li>
	<li>There are quite a few variables being set within the method by iterating through a database query result. I'm guessing $fromfile, $PassedValue, and $doAction are all set in that foreach. How many others?</li>
</ul>
Evil.  Pure evil.
