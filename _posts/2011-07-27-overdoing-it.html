I am not making this shit up.
<pre lang="PHP">
Function mail_attachment($from, $to, $subject, $message, $attachment) {
    . . .
    $email_from = $from; // Who the email is from
    $email_subject = $subject; // The Subject of the email
    $email_txt = $message; // Message that the email has in it
    $email_to = $to; // Who the email is to
    . . .
}</pre>
