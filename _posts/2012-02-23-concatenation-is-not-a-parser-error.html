CSI: PHP isn't big on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perp_walk">perp walk</a>, but if your crime is (1) public and (2) licensed with an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> Creative Commons license, then you kinda <a href="http://jayjohnston.com/php/possible-php-parser-error">perp walked yourself</a>.

<pre lang="PHP">
// What will this print out in php5?
$earth = 'World';
$string1 = "Hello " .
$string2 = $earth . '!';
$string = $string1 . $string2;

echo $string;
</pre>

The author posits the output, <code>Hello World!World!</code>, is a possible parser error or internal assignment nonsense.  What <code>Hello World!World!</code> actually represents is PHP string handling and variable assignment 101.

I will concede that determining the output of <code>$string</code> is something of a light brain teaser.  However, if you're confused by concatenation and variable assignment to the point that you <a href="http://jayjohnston.com/php/possible-php-parser-error">write a blog post about it</a> and present it as a parser error, I can only hope and pray you're trolling.

Exit question, "If a plane crashes on the border of Canada and the United States, where do you bury the survivors?"
