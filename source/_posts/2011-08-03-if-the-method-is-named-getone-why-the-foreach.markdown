I'll leave this to you to rip apart. Â My head hurts too bad from banging it against the desk to do any real analysis, and it's not even my code.

```php
<?php
class Db
{
    // snip

    function getOneWithDetail($id=0)
    {
        $q = $this->createQuery('t')
            ->orderBy('t.title ASC')
            ->where('t.id = ?', $id);
        $objCollection = $q->execute();
        foreach ($objCollection as $objTitle) {
            return $objTitle; //there should be only one 
        }
    }

    // snip
}
```
