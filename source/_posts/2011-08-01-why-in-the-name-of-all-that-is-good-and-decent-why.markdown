This is one of the few comment blocks that accurately describes the code contained in the script. I wish it didn't.

```
    /*
    *
    *    Written by [redacted] the purpose of this script is to Bounce
    *    shall-not.be-named.com requests to the appropriate web page
    *    within the Iframe.
    *
    *    Basically the 3rd party site creates an Iframe
    *    Within in the Iframe it calls this script
    *    and passes various variables
    *    This Script evaluates the pageid variable
    *    And basically constructs a partial page that
    *    MAY include legal disclamers
    *    And then either URL encodes or Posts the
    *    Variables necessary
    *    Launches a remote application or site within
    *    the Iframe created below
    *
    *    Gotchas: You have two Iframes... One at the other
    *    site and One created Here... Scroll Bar Sizing Issues
    *
    */
```

That ain't the only gotcha, bud.
