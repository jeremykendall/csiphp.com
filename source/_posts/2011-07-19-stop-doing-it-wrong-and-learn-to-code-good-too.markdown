We spend all of our time here at CSI: PHP teaching by counter-example.  And by "teaching by counter-example", I mean pointing and laughing at criminally horrific code.  Every once in a while, we'd like to add something to the mix to help teach by example.

I posted this question to my developer friends on Twitter this morning.

I've gotten tons of great replies, so I figured I'd share them with you.  Do you have any suggestions or recommendations?  Drop them in the comments below, and help our fellow developers to stop doing it wrong and learn to code good too.
