This is a fun one. It's being called 12 separate times in a 228 line switch statement, with all of the calls inside [if/else](http://us.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.else.php) and nested if/else statements.

```php
<?php
function getRules($conn, $dbn, $app, $table, $action, $actiontype, $RecordID='')
{
    global $self;
    $savTBL = $table;
    require_once "../common.inc";
    if ((!$table) || ($table = '')) {
        return(0);
    } else {
        $Q = "SELECT * FROM dbrules WHERE ontable = '$savTBL' AND onaction = '$action' AND app = '$app' AND actiontype = '$actiontype' ORDER BY doorder ";
        $R = mSDoQuery($conn, $dbn, $Q);
        if (mssql_num_rows($R) == 0) {
            return(0);
        }
        While ($row = mssql_fetch_assoc($R)) {
            foreach ($row AS $Key => $Value) {
                $$Key = $Value;
            }
            if ($fromfile <> '') {
                require_once "$fromfile";
            }
            if ($PassedValue <> '') {
                eval("$PassedValue" . ";");
            }
            if ($doAction) {
                eval("$doAction" . ";");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

A few details:

* common.inc is a ~2,000 line file with 22 "common" functions, only one of which is used in `getRules()`.
* Don't let `$self` fool you, this isn't a class method. `$self` is set to `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];`.
* The function parameters are set from from `$_GET`, an included config file, a database query, with only two being hard coded.
* There are quite a few variables being set within the method by iterating through a database query result. I'm guessing `$fromfile`, `$PassedValue`, and `$doAction` are all set in that `foreach`. How many others?

Evil.  Pure evil.
