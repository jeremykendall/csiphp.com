It all began with a new gig and an amazingly horrific codebase.  I began tweeting 
the <a href="http://twitter.com/JeremyKendall/status/55692255276711936">most unbelievable</a>, 
<a href="http://twitter.com/JeremyKendall/status/83592096224780288">most frustrating</a> 
snippets I could find.  After quite a few of those tweets, Chris Hartjes 
<a href="http://twitter.com/chartjes/status/55692693929607168">replied with</a>, 
"_Looking at your tweets I cannot even fathom what your job is. CSI:PHP?_"  A concept was born.

Twitter's 140 characters are rarely enough to share the horrors of bad code, and 
I don't want to give short shrift to the nefarious and misguided scripts that I've 
found.  Behold the CSI: PHP blog, where I investigate criminally bad codebases 
and share the evidence with you, my fellow developers.

**Disclaimer**: Any code that might reveal the author's identity or the author's 
employer have been sanitized. <a href="http://twitter.com/JeremyKendall/status/83619994004492288">I've written plenty of horrific code</a> 
myself, and will be including code snippets from my own projects along the way.

## Praise for CSI: PHP
