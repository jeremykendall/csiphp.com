CSI: PHP isn't a solo project.  We depend on the hard work and brainpower of trained CSI: PHP investigators world-wide.  If you've seen evidence of a PHP crime, please file a report with headquarters.  That's us.

Your report should be short and sweet.  It must include a code sample (ideally using <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> or <a href="http://pastebin.com/">pastebin</a> or the like) and a brief description of the crime.  Bonus points for describing how the crime could have been avoided or can be corrected, and super bonus points for unit tests.

Finally, please let us know how you'd like to be recognized.  Have a blog you'd like pimped?  Want a link to your Twitter profile?  Or should this be an anonymous submission?

We look forward to hearing from you, and keep up the good work.
