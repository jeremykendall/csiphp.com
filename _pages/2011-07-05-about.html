It all began with a new gig and an amazingly horrific codebase.  I began tweeting the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JeremyKendall/status/55692255276711936">most unbelievable</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JeremyKendall/status/83592096224780288">most frustrating</a> snippets I could find.  After quite a few of those tweets, Chris Hartjes <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chartjes/status/55692693929607168">replied with</a>, "<em>Looking at your tweets I cannot even fathom what your job is. CSI:PHP ?</em>"  A concept was born.

Twitter's 140 characters are rarely enough to share the horrors of bad code, and I don't want to give short shrift to the nefarious and misguided scripts that I've found.  Behold the CSI: PHP blog, where I investigate criminally bad codebases and share the evidence with you, my fellow developers.

<strong>Praise for CSI: PHP</strong>

	<li>You meant for that to be an apache test page, right? -- <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jimbojsb/statuses/88328306914635776">Josh Butts</a></li>
	<li>So is there supposed to be something else than the default Apache test page? -- <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jhartikainen/statuses/88328583306674176">Jani Hartikainen</a></li>
	<li>Um...isn't this all just PHP.DailyWTF.com? -- <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SandyS1/statuses/88352693520830466">Sandy Smith</a></li>
